1. BELOHA, Madagascar – “Water, water…this is real water,” says Beamby, a resident of Marovato village in southern Madagascar. He left his home early in the morning and walked an hour to Beloha to witness the opening of a new 180-kilometre-long water pipeline.
Water has become a rare and precious resource in this part of Madagascar. The southern region has the lowest water coverage in the country, and suffers major impacts of climate change, including more frequent and intense droughts.
The new water pipeline will make water widely available to 40,000 people.</p>

<p class="t"> Ravolabe, a mother of five children, is thrilled to see the water gushing from the tap at one of the 19 community water points supplied by the pipeline. Like everyone living in the area, she previously had to walk up to 20 kilometres to find water – a chore that falls almost exclusively to women – or she was forced to pay for it at a prohibitive cost. Although a single 20-litre jerrycan of water costs just US$0.50, the average income per person per year in this region is approximately US$50; that's less than $US1 per week.</p>

<p class="t"> Andrianarisoa Nambinina, who runs a basic health centre in the village of Nikoly, says that because of the pipeline, her patients will now be able to get safe water within the centre. Staff there are also delighted as they will no longer have to go out in search of water elsewhere in the community – and get water that is often unclean.</p>
<br>
<p class="t">The pipeline is the result of more than two years of collaboration between the Government of Madagascar and UNICEF to upgrade existing water infrastructure. This included setting up a water treatment plant, boreholes and pumping stations; extending the existing pipeline by an additional 90 kilometres; and establishing a network of water points across the region.</p>

<p class="t">Beamby arrives after walking an hour to attend the inauguration ceremony of the pipeline.
Plans are already in place to further expand the project to reach an additional 15,000 people in areas affected by drought.
“This is a relief for the whole population who see this as a dream come true,” says Beamby. “We never thought we’d be drinking clear water one day. So long to the chocolate-coloured water from before.”</p>

<p class="t">2. Luisa (identity protected) shares a three-roomed apartment with her mother, step-father and 9 other family members. Her step-father lost his job in construction in 2007 and her mom has been unable to find any lasting work. The family relies on a soup kitchen for food and donations of clothing from neighbors.
'One day my friend saw me at the soup kitchen and since then my friends don’t talk to me anymore and treat me like someone who is in need.''What I would like in the future is to change the world, to do what I can to help people, to help the poor and give them what they need. Everybody will have a stable house.
 Everybody will be well and nobody will be in need.'

<p class="t">3. Growing up in the one of the most dangerous cities in the United States of America, Marcell Jenkins, 12, never ventures more than a few blocks from his home alone. Camden, once a thriving industrial city in the state of New Jersey, has been in decline for decades. Today it is per capita one of the poorest cities in the USA with high unemployment and crime rates.
In recent years, Camden has become a haven for drug-dealers who openly ply their trade on the streets. To make matters worse, nearly half the city’s already beleaguered police force was recently laid off due to budget cuts.
Marcell’s own life has been shaped by these problems. “My parents were in the street on drugs and they weren’t fit to be parents, so I had to come and live with my grandmother,” he says. Like so many parents and care-givers, Marcell’s 76-year-old grandmother, who receives limited government assistance, struggles to give her grandson every opportunity to succeed in a very challenging environment. Camden has a 70 per cent high school dropout rate, with only 13 per cent of students managing to pass the state's proficiency exams in mathematics.</p>
