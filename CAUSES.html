        <h1 class="h1"><strong>Causes Of Poverty</strong></h1>

        <p class="p"><strong>1. Inadequate access to clean water and nutritious food</strong></p>
        <p class="a"> ------- Many people suffer from poverty because they have a hard time getting supplies such as water. More than 2 billion people don't have access to clean water, while 800 million suffer from hunger. Even if clean water sources are available, they’re often located far from poor, rural communities. This means that women and girls collectively spend some 200 million hours every day walking long distances to fetch water. That's time that could be used working, or getting an education to help secure a job later in life.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>2. Little or no access to livelihoods or jobs</strong></p>
        <p class="a"> ------- Plenty of individuals around the globe have the challenge of getting jobs or opportunities. Part of the reason why is that jobs in some part of the world are very hard to access, especially if countries have dwindling access to productive land or an overexploitation of resources.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>3. Conflict</strong></p>
        <p class="a"> ------- Conflict such as war can occur anywhere and implement difficulties for individuals. Specifically, war can cause people to lose their homes and many important supplies needed for survival.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>4. Inequality</strong></p>
        <p class="a"> ------- Many different types of inequality appear around the world. For example, certain people of different minorities, gender, or sexuality might not have a voice in this world, or might be paid differently, e.t.c.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>5. Poor education</strong></p>
        <p class="a"> ------- Education can be a huge cause of poverty. Many educational programs or schools are expensive causing different families to have a lack of education and becoming poor.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>7. Lack of infrastructure</strong></p>
        <p class="a"> ------- Infrastructure can affect individuals' lives because with it in place people can travel more easily. Additionally, public works allow individuals to open up more businesses and other things. Therefore, without these infrastructures many poeple can become productive.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>6. Climate change</strong></p>
        <p class="a"> ------- Climate change impacts poverty significantly. Many individuals who are already poor rely on farming to obtain their resources. However, with climate change the agricultural areas are damaged and the poor are left with barely anything.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>8. Limited government capacity</strong></p>
        <p class="a"> ------- While many governments, such as the US's, are able to provide benefits like healthcare to it's citizens, many countries are not financially stable enough to do this. Without this, nothing can stop vulnerable people and their families from sliding into extreme poverty. As mentioned above, they may also be unable to provide the infrastructure or ensure the safety which the citizens need.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong>9. Lack of reserves</strong></p>
        <p class="a"> ------- People living in poverty don’t have the means to weather the storms of life. So when there is a drought, or conflict, or illness, there is little money saved or assets on hand to help. In Ethiopia for example, repeated cycles of drought have caused harvest after harvest to fail, causing a widespread hunger crisis. To cope, families will pull their children from school, and sell off everything they own to eat. That can help a family make it through one bad season, but not another. For communities constantly facing climate extremes or prolonged conflict, the repeated shocks can send a family reeling into extreme poverty and prevent them from ever recovering.</p>

      <p class="graphp">This graph shows the trend of the poverty rates across the globe, stretching from 1820 to 2015. In 1820, the vast majority of the world lived in extreme poverty; only a small elite portion enjoyed higher standards of living. More than a century later, in 1970, the number of people living in extreme poverty peaked at 2.2 billion.  A couple of decades later, in 2015, the United Nations member states adopted several goals to end poverty and hunger worldwide.</p>
