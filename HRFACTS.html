<p><i>The graph above shows portions of continents that have scarce water resources. There are sectors on the map that show physical or economic water scarcity.
  For example, in parts of Asia and Africa, many regions display a lack of water.  </p></i>

<p class="morefacts">1 in every 9 people go to sleep hungry every night. That's roughly 795 million people. So why? The world produces enough food to feed the 7 billion plus people we have on the planet. It's because many starving or hungry people around the world do not have the means to grow or buy food. <br><br> <b><i>Chronic hunger goes hand in hand with poverty.</b></i> <br><br>Conflict has also displaced millions of people, preventing them from cultivating their land. Other causes include climate change, with severe drought and flooding having devastated crop yields and decimated livestock; the lack of education, which prevents people from getting decent jobs; and child marriage and gender inequality, which keep females suppressed and poor.

      <p><i>The map above displays places with distinct levels of sanitation. Even though this map shows    high percentages of sanitation in many areas, the noticeable points are the areas that are pink in color.
        The locations that are pink in color demonstrate the areas that have 0-40% of sanitation,a low percentage.<p></i>
